# Ready Player Me embedded in a React Native WebView

This example showcases embedding [Ready Player Me](https://readyplayer.me) avatar creator as a `WebView` to React Native mobile applications and retrieving the URL to the 3D model of the avatar.

The example uses the cross-platform (iOS, Android, MacOS, Windows) [react-native-webview](https://github.com/react-native-webview/react-native-webview) module to load and interact with Ready Player Me inside a WebView.
